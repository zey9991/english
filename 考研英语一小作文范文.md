Dear Paul, 

Quite pleased to receive your email and I am writing for the purpose of making suggestions on your preparation for the oral report.

It is reading this book that will enable you to know more ancient scientists and select the one you are interested in. Then, you are supposed to search for certain pictures of the scientist and his or her major achievements on the Internet, which may bring you inspiration, arouse your passion for exploring, and help you make the report successfully. You can also print the pictures out and show them during your report. If you have any other questions, please feel free to inform me.

Dear Paul,

I’m very pleased that you have come to seek advice on your oral report on ancient Chinese scientists from me. Below are my thoughts. Feel free to communicate with me anytime.

Actually, a lot of scientists pop in my mind, however, Lu Ban, the Chinese master carpenter is the one I have to recommend. How can we do a oral report about him? Firstly, introduce the character Lu Ban from the popular mobile game King of Glory in China, which will definitely attract everyone’s interest . Secondly, describe detailed information of Lu Ban, such as his dynasty, achievements. I’m sure you can find that on Wikipedia.

I believe you will successfully complete the report and I’m looking forward to your good news.

Yours sincerely,

Thus, the Students’ Union is supposed to hold beneficial activities to inspire and encourage youngsters to participate in sports.

I am convinced that with these measures, students’ physical condition will be improved to a large extent.

Since most of the time is spent in watching TV and playing computer games, our physical conditions are not good enough. i still have some suggestions for you. To begin with, our university should arrange more PE classes. To continue, we should have a fixed schedule for a certain time of outdoor activity.

I hope that our university could take the responsibility for our students’ physical health. I will be highly grateful if you could take my suggestions into account.

Dear Mr. President，

I am a student of our university. And I am writing this letter to bring forward some effective suggestions to our college students about how to improve their body health.

Initially, exercising, though not a student's first priority in his/her daily life, should be stressed by all of us as well as our university, because it is vital to not only our physical health but mental health as well. Furthermore, developing a regular and healthy diet, which provides vitamins and other nutrients to our body, would undoubtedly benefit our body.

I hope that you will find my suggestions useful and propagandas be launched among the students. I am looking forward to your earlier response.

Yours sincerely，

Li Ming

　Dear Mr. President,

　　I am writing to put forward some suggestions concerning the ways to improve student's physical condition in your university. My proposals are as the following.

　　First and foremost, I propose that we should take advantages of physical education classes on our campus, and not only educate students to realize the significance of the classes, but also to encourage students to take an active part in the classes. More importantly, we should attach importance to the role played by extra-curricular activates. For example, we could plan and organize a large number of such ball games as football games, basketball games and so on.

　　It's my honor to share my opinions concerned with you. If you could take my advice into consideration, I will be highly grateful.

　　Sincerely yours,

　　Li Ming
