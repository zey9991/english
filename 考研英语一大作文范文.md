**Unfolded** in the **elaborately**-painted left cartoon is an **enlightening** scene that two citizens are jogging in the public fitness area and a young adult nearby proudly says, “The new park which was built near my home is so **desirable**”. In the right bar chart, we can see that the number of parks in a city rose sharply from 406 in 2020 to 670 in 2022. There is no doubt that its symbolic meaning subtly conveyed should be given deep consideration.

What the picture and the chart convey are a favorable phenomenon that even more people now increasingly pay close attention to doing exercise, which is vital to a society. The following factors, from my perspective, might illustrate this theme. First and foremost, doing exercise is beneficial to physical health and it can help reduce obesity and lower fat content by promoting blood circulation. This is why more youngsters are willing to participate in exercise regularly in life. What's more, it can be attributed to the relevant policy from our government to promote the growth of parks According to a survey conducted by China Research Center, up to 1000 new parks were built last year all over the nation in order to encourage citizens to do exercise.

In summary, active nationwide involvement in physical exercise brings dual benefits of physical and mental wellness. The government should strengthen promotion and encouragement to help citizens develop good exercise habits and routines. Only with participation from all sectors of the society can we build a physically strong and energetic community.

In the left image, we see two individuals jogging in a newly established public fitness area, with a young man exclaiming, "The new park near my home is truly **exceptional**!" Meanwhile, the bar chart on the right illustrates a significant rise in the number of parks within the city, from 406 in 2020 to 670 in 2022. The deeper significance behind this **juxtaposition** merits thoughtful reflection.

What both the image and chart reveal is an encouraging **societal shift**: an increasing number of individuals are prioritizing physical exercise, a fundamental **pillar** of public health. Several factors account for this trend. Foremost, regular physical activity is widely recognized for its immense benefits to overall health, including reducing obesity rates and improving **cardiovascular** function. This growing awareness has led more young people to incorporate exercise into their daily routines. Moreover, this development can largely be attributed to government policies aimed at enhancing public well-being by expanding the number of public parks. A recent study by a national research institute reported the construction of over 1,000 new parks across the country last year, underscoring a commitment to fostering a healthier, more active **citizenry**.

In conclusion, the widespread engagement in physical exercise serves a dual purpose: promoting both physical fitness and mental **resilience**. It is **imperative** for the government to further intensify its efforts to cultivate a culture of regular physical activity. Only through a **concerted** effort from all sectors of society can we realize the vision of a healthier, more dynamic community.

The image and bar chart above vividly illustrate the escalating importance of public parks. On the left, a young boy enthusiastically gestures towards a recently **inaugurated** park, declaring, "This park is really nice," as several individuals engage in jogging and leisurely strolls in the background. Conversely, the bar chart highlights a remarkable **surge** in the number of parks, **escalating** from 406 in 2020 to 670 in 2022.

The implications of these **visuals** are **unequivocal**. Firstly, an increasing number of individuals are acknowledging the significance of health, leading to parks—known for their fresh air and **picturesque** landscapes—emerging as a preferred **recreational** choice. Moreover, the **proliferation** of parks is **intricately** linked to governmental initiatives; without adequate governmental support, relevant departments may **falter** in allocating the necessary funding for park development. This trend is also associated with broader economic advancement, as improved economic conditions afford citizens greater leisure time and motivation to visit parks, while simultaneously equipping governments with enhanced financial resources for infrastructure projects.

In summary, the phenomenon observed can be attributed to several underlying factors. I am convinced that the expansion of public parks presents substantial benefits for both individuals and society at large.

**Unfolded in the intricately illustrated cartoon is an eye-catching and thought-provoking scene:** a group of young men enthusiastically row dragon boats, while a large crowd gathers to enjoy the race. An elderly grandmother, turning to her spouse with a cheerful smile, **exclaims**, “How wonderful it is that Dragon Boat racing is becoming ever more vibrant in our village.” Clearly, what the cartoonist seeks to emphasize is the importance of preserving and passing down traditional culture.

There is no denying that in recent years, Chinese people have been **placing paramount importance on** **revitalizing** and carrying forward traditional cultural legacies. Traditions, much like tangible cultural heritages such as the Great Wall and the Forbidden City, are to be cherished and passed down from generation to generation. Intangible cultural heritages—such as Peking Opera and the celebration of traditional festivals—are equally vital. As a nation rich in ethnic diversity and with a long and profound history, China **is** **endowed** **with** a wealth of intangible cultural heritages, which connect us to our ancestors and provide us with a cultural identity. Without these legacies, we would **be rendered rootless**, unable to face contemporary and future challenges.

However, modernization, despite its numerous benefits, poses increasing threats to intangible cultural heritages. It is **disheartening** to witness the passing away of elderly people who hold the knowledge of these traditions without transferring them to younger generations. **In light of** these considerations, it is **imperative** that we not only preserve but also **rejuvenate** our **ancestral heritages.** By doing so, we contribute to the preservation of cultural diversity on a global scale, ensuring that these traditions continue to enrich humanity for generations to come.

**Displayed in the picture is a vibrant and dynamic scene of** a dragon boat race, part of a traditional Chinese festival. Evidently, the two teams are rowing with **unwavering** determination, while a crowd of young **spectators** on the shore enthusiastically cheer for the competitors. Particularly noteworthy is the elderly couple’s comment, joyfully observing how these cultural activities have become increasingly **vibrant** and widespread in recent years. This **speaks to** the **revival** of traditional practices that has garnered increasing attention from all generations.

There is no denying that, in recent years, Chinese people have placed paramount importance on preserving and revitalizing traditional culture. Cultural legacies, both tangible and intangible, are the **lifeblood** that **sustains a nation’s identity**. Tangible cultural heritages, such as the Great Wall and the Forbidden City, alongside intangible ones like Peking Opera and the celebration of traditional festivals, are equally vital. As a country blessed with a rich diversity of ethnic groups and a long history, China **boasts** an abundance of intangible cultural heritages, which **bridge the present and the past**, granting individuals a deep sense of cultural and historical identity. Without these invaluable heritages, we risk becoming culturally **unanchored**, **adrift in the tides of modernization**.

However, modernization **poses** increasing **threats** **to** these traditions, as the pace of contemporary life often **sidelines** such legacies. It is disheartening to witness elderly custodians of these cultural treasures pass away without passing their knowledge on to younger generations. In light of these challenges, we must not only preserve but also **breathe new life into** these ancestral traditions. Only by doing so can we ensure the **perpetuation** of cultural diversity, contributing to the rich **mosaic** of human civilization in our increasingly globalized world.

The image portrays two students standing in front of a campus lecture poster. The student on the left dismisses the lecture as irrelevant to his major, **deeming** it unnecessary. In contrast, the student on the right counters with a broader perspective, suggesting that the lecture could be beneficial for their overall development. This vividly illustrates the divergent attitudes individuals may adopt when faced with the same opportunity.

Persistent learning enables us to continuously engage in meaningful pursuits, despite challenges or setbacks. Moreover, a prepared mind equips us with the **resilience** to confront future challenges and **lays** **the** **groundwork** **for** eventual success. According to a recent global survey, approximately 76.5% of respondents affirmed that they are willing to pursue diverse knowledge, as they believe opportunities **favor** those who are prepared.

In conclusion, only when we fully comprehend the importance of broad learning and **readiness** can we integrate this mindset into our daily lives and make consistent progress. Hence, mass media, including television and the Internet, should promote this positive mentality. As college students, we too must seize every opportunity to expand our knowledge, thereby securing a promising future.

The image vividly illustrates two students standing in front of a campus lecture poster. The student on the left expresses his opinion, claiming that since the lecture is unrelated to his major, it is of no use. In contrast, his peer **contends** that the lecture might contribute to both academic and personal growth. This scenario highlights the divergent attitudes people adopt toward the same opportunity.

Undoubtedly, the author strives to convey a profound message: one must always be well-prepared for opportunities. It is through continuous learning that we remain capable of achieving admirable accomplishments, even in the face of challenges and setbacks. Moreover, a prepared mind not only **energizes** us to confront future challenges but also lays a solid foundation for success. A recent survey conducted by an international organization revealed that approximately 76.5% of respondents believe that extensive learning is key to being ready for unexpected opportunities, reinforcing the idea that luck **favors** the prepared.

**Weighing the aforementioned factors**, it becomes clear that only when we fully grasp the importance of preparation and actively pursue knowledge can we foster the mindset needed for future success. Therefore, the mass media, including television and the Internet, should play a **pivotal** role in advocating a **proactive** and **growth-oriented** mindset.

Clearly, the picture above illustrates the divergent attitudes students hold towards campus lectures. As vividly depicted, the girl on the left dismisses the lecture, claiming, "We will not benefit much from the lecture, as it’s not directly related to our major." In contrast, the girl on the right argues, "We will gain something useful as long as we attend."

This image **underscores** an important message: college students should not **limit** **their attention solely to** their specialized fields of study. Several reasons support this view. Firstly, individuals equipped with a **well-rounded** set of knowledge and skills are more **competitive** in the job market. In other words, compared to those whose **expertise** is confined to a single discipline, those with broader capabilities have significantly more opportunities and a greater potential for career advancement. Secondly, focusing exclusively on one’s major while neglecting other areas of knowledge **hinders** students from applying what they have learned in a **holistic** manner, whether in their future careers or personal lives.

Thus, it is essential for college students to pursue comprehensive development by acquiring a diverse range of knowledge and skills. Only by embracing a wide array of disciplines can they make substantial progress and secure a brighter future.

**As is vividly depicted in the photo,** a father and his son, both dressed in traditional Chinese opera costumes, are engaged in a conversation, which naturally captures our attention. ==What== **adds more depth to** the image ==is== the son's **disheartened** remark, “Dad, my classmates find Chinese opera **tedious**,”==to which== the father gently responds, “What matters is that you enjoy it.” The picture **subtly yet powerfully** conveys the **notion** that self-confidence, particularly in the face of differing opinions, is crucial, and this concept **merits further reflection**.

**Portrayed distinctively by the two cartoons above is** an impressive scene: a girl in the left cartoon is completing her homework and **asserting** that early completion is preferable. Conversely, the boy in the right cartoon is seated at his desk, stating that he will not finish his homework until the last minute.

Undoubtedly, the symbolic implication of the pictures is to highlight the importance of cultivating good habits, ==particularly== the habit of effective time management. On one hand, efficient time management is critical to personal development. As the old saying goes, "Time is money." In our fast-paced modern life, it appears that we are constantly faced with numerous tasks and responsibilities. In such a context, it is essential to recognize that efficiency is the key to saving time, and time management skills inevitably lead to personal success. On the other hand, good time management habits play a vital role in the advancement of society as a whole. There is no doubt that social progress is closely linked to the efforts of each individual. If we can cultivate effective time management habits, we are far more likely to enhance our efficiency and achieve better performance in both learning and working processes, contributing significantly to societal advancement and prosperity.

In light of the aforementioned points, we can conclude that the importance of efficient time management skills is equally vital for both personal and social progress. Therefore, we should **leverage** this phenomenon to enlighten the public, and the media is expected to take the lead in promoting the value of developing good time management habits. Only in this way can we secure a bright future.

**As is vividly portrayed in the set of cartoons**, the drawing on the left depicts a girl diligently working on her assignments, asserting, “My heart will rest after I finish my work.” It can be **surmised** that she has been working for a significant amount of time, as her notebook is far from empty. In contrast, the drawing on the right illustrates a boy **lounging on** a sofa, **proclaiming**, “I would not take action until the very last minute.”

Clearly, the cartoonist intends to **commend** the girl ==while== **critiquing** the boy. It is undeniable that taking action is often less comfortable than resting. However, engaging in tasks early proves to be beneficial, while **procrastination** typically exacerbates the situation. If we begin our assignments early, we are likely to complete them ahead of time, allowing ample opportunity to review our work thoroughly. Moreover, thorough checking invariably leads to refinement. Conversely, if we develop a habit of procrastination and become accustomed to submitting our assignments at the last possible moment, we will have limited time for revisions, resulting in **a plethora of** mistakes in our submissions.

All in all, we should cultivate the habit of taking action early, as this practice is inevitably advantageous for us. Furthermore, the mass media shoulder the responsibility of encouraging individuals, especially college students, to embrace early action. Therefore, it is imperative that the media plays an active role in promoting the value of early action among individuals, particularly college students.
