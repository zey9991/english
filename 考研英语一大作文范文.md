### 2024 公园（图 + 表）

In the drawing, there is a park, in which several residents are doing physical exercise, with smiles on their faces. One of them comments, “This nearby newly-built park is gorgeous!” Meanwhile, a chart can be noticed, which illustrates that the number of parks increased remarkably, from 406 in 2020 to 670 in 2022. 

Such scenarios, apparently, can be associated with the significant role of parks in people’s daily life. In recent years, China was characterized by its boom and prosperity in economy, which enabled the government to possess extra financial budgets to construct infrastructures, including parks. This phenomenon is particularly worth attention for the reason that parks can bring citizens places to relax or do sports, arouse their passion for life, and help them enjoy convenience. A case in point is me. As a senior who is preparing for the national entrance examination for postgraduate studies, I get up early every day to do sports in the nearby park. It is this positive habit that enables me to keep healthy and efficient. 

Thus, it is advisable for the government to build more parks for the public. Meanwhile, society as a whole is supposed to foster a positive atmosphere of protecting the harmonious and beautiful environment of parks.

**Unfolded** in the **elaborately**-painted left cartoon is an **enlightening** scene that two citizens are jogging in the public fitness area and a young adult nearby proudly says, “The new park which was built near my home is so **desirable**”. In the right bar chart, we can see that the number of parks in a city rose sharply from 406 in 2020 to 670 in 2022. There is no doubt that its symbolic meaning subtly conveyed should be given deep consideration.

What the picture and the chart convey are a favorable phenomenon that even more people now increasingly pay close attention to doing exercise, which is vital to a society. The following factors, from my perspective, might illustrate this theme. First and foremost, doing exercise is beneficial to physical health and it can help reduce obesity and lower fat content by promoting blood circulation. This is why more youngsters are willing to participate in exercise regularly in life. What's more, it can be attributed to the relevant policy from our government to promote the growth of parks According to a survey conducted by China Research Center, up to 1000 new parks were built last year all over the nation in order to encourage citizens to do exercise.

In summary, active nationwide involvement in physical exercise brings dual benefits of physical and mental wellness. The government should strengthen promotion and encouragement to help citizens develop good exercise habits and routines. Only with participation from all sectors of the society can we build a physically strong and energetic community.

In the left image, we see two individuals jogging in a newly established public fitness area, with a young man exclaiming, "The new park near my home is truly **exceptional**!" Meanwhile, the bar chart on the right illustrates a significant rise in the number of parks within the city, from 406 in 2020 to 670 in 2022. The deeper significance behind this **juxtaposition** merits thoughtful reflection.

What both the image and chart reveal is an encouraging **societal shift**: an increasing number of individuals are prioritizing physical exercise, a fundamental **pillar** of public health. Several factors account for this trend. Foremost, regular physical activity is widely recognized for its immense benefits to overall health, including reducing obesity rates and improving **cardiovascular** function. This growing awareness has led more young people to incorporate exercise into their daily routines. Moreover, this development can largely be attributed to government policies aimed at enhancing public well-being by expanding the number of public parks. A recent study by a national research institute reported the construction of over 1,000 new parks across the country last year, underscoring a commitment to fostering a healthier, more active **citizenry**.

In conclusion, the widespread engagement in physical exercise serves a dual purpose: promoting both physical fitness and mental **resilience**. It is **imperative** for the government to further intensify its efforts to cultivate a culture of regular physical activity. Only through a **concerted** effort from all sectors of society can we realize the vision of a healthier, more dynamic community.

The image and bar chart above vividly illustrate the escalating importance of public parks. On the left, a young boy enthusiastically gestures towards a recently **inaugurated** park, declaring, "This park is really nice," as several individuals engage in jogging and leisurely strolls in the background. Conversely, the bar chart highlights a remarkable **surge** in the number of parks, **escalating** from 406 in 2020 to 670 in 2022.

The implications of these **visuals** are **unequivocal**. Firstly, an increasing number of individuals are acknowledging the significance of health, leading to parks—known for their fresh air and **picturesque** landscapes—emerging as a preferred **recreational** choice. Moreover, the **proliferation** of parks is **intricately** linked to governmental initiatives; without adequate governmental support, relevant departments may **falter** in allocating the necessary funding for park development. This trend is also associated with broader economic advancement, as improved economic conditions afford citizens greater leisure time and motivation to visit parks, while simultaneously equipping governments with enhanced financial resources for infrastructure projects.

In summary, the phenomenon observed can be attributed to several underlying factors. I am convinced that the expansion of public parks presents substantial benefits for both individuals and society at large.

### 2023 乡村文化活动

![nq7JRAH6pM](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zey9991/mdpic/202408232223978.png)

#### 石雷鹏

In a river, there is a dragon boat race, with thousands of villagers standing around and cheering up. Meanwhile, it can be noticed that a grandma is talking with a grandpa, “Amazing, the dragon boat race in our village is becoming increasingly lively.” 

China is characterized by its time-honored history and diverse cultural traditions, such as the Dragon Boat Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Spring Festival. To preserve the cultural heritage, Chinese people, especially those in the countryside, still hold various traditional ceremonies. This phenomenon is particularly worth attention for the reason that these activities bring us a happy atmosphere, inspire our passion for traditional culture and help us know China’s history better. To my understanding, traditional culture can be likened to a bridge, linking the past and today. A case in point is the dragon boat race in the picture. It is this sort of competition that enables teenagers in China to know Qu Yuan and his great patriotism. 

Accordingly, society as a whole should foster a positive atmosphere to educate and encourage young people to participate in traditional cultural activities. In the meantime, everyone should bear in mind that our history and culture is the root of the nation.

**Unfolded in the intricately illustrated cartoon is an eye-catching and thought-provoking scene:** a group of young men enthusiastically row dragon boats, while a large crowd gathers to enjoy the race. An elderly grandmother, turning to her spouse with a cheerful smile, **exclaims**, “How wonderful it is that Dragon Boat racing is becoming ever more vibrant in our village.” Clearly, what the cartoonist seeks to emphasize is the importance of preserving and passing down traditional culture.

There is no denying that in recent years, Chinese people have been **placing paramount importance on** **revitalizing** and carrying forward traditional cultural legacies. Traditions, much like tangible cultural heritages such as the Great Wall and the Forbidden City, are to be cherished and passed down from generation to generation. Intangible cultural heritages—such as Peking Opera and the celebration of traditional festivals—are equally vital. As a nation rich in ethnic diversity and with a long and profound history, China **is** **endowed** **with** a wealth of intangible cultural heritages, which connect us to our ancestors and provide us with a cultural identity. Without these legacies, we would **be rendered rootless**, unable to face contemporary and future challenges.

However, modernization, despite its numerous benefits, poses increasing threats to intangible cultural heritages. It is **disheartening** to witness the passing away of elderly people who hold the knowledge of these traditions without transferring them to younger generations. **In light of** these considerations, it is **imperative** that we not only preserve but also **rejuvenate** our **ancestral heritages.** By doing so, we contribute to the preservation of cultural diversity on a global scale, ensuring that these traditions continue to enrich humanity for generations to come.

**Displayed in the picture is a vibrant and dynamic scene of** a dragon boat race, part of a traditional Chinese festival. Evidently, the two teams are rowing with **unwavering** determination, while a crowd of young **spectators** on the shore enthusiastically cheer for the competitors. Particularly noteworthy is the elderly couple’s comment, joyfully observing how these cultural activities have become increasingly **vibrant** and widespread in recent years. This **speaks to** the **revival** of traditional practices that has garnered increasing attention from all generations.

There is no denying that, in recent years, Chinese people have placed paramount importance on preserving and revitalizing traditional culture. Cultural legacies, both tangible and intangible, are the **lifeblood** that **sustains a nation’s identity**. Tangible cultural heritages, such as the Great Wall and the Forbidden City, alongside intangible ones like Peking Opera and the celebration of traditional festivals, are equally vital. As a country blessed with a rich diversity of ethnic groups and a long history, China **boasts** an abundance of intangible cultural heritages, which **bridge the present and the past**, granting individuals a deep sense of cultural and historical identity. Without these invaluable heritages, we risk becoming culturally **unanchored**, **adrift in the tides of modernization**.

However, modernization **poses** increasing **threats** **to** these traditions, as the pace of contemporary life often **sidelines** such legacies. It is disheartening to witness elderly custodians of these cultural treasures pass away without passing their knowledge on to younger generations. In light of these challenges, we must not only preserve but also **breathe new life into** these ancestral traditions. Only by doing so can we ensure the **perpetuation** of cultural diversity, contributing to the rich **mosaic** of human civilization in our increasingly globalized world.

Such a cartoon, apparently, can be associated with two distinct attitudes towards learning. Why? Let us observe it closely. Beside a bulletin board, there is a girl, pointing at the board and commenting ：“This lecture is not concerning our major and it is worthless to listen to it. “ However, the other girl, with short hair, says ：“It is definitely good to learn something!”

Successful figures, to my understanding, are characterized by their various merits, such as diligence, optimism, curiosity and positive attitude towards learning. Nonetheless, in reality, a host of youngsters are reluctant to acquire knowledge or skills beyond their majors. As a matter of fact, this shortsighted behavior has constituted an obstacle that hinders young people’s growth and progress in personal development. As a college student, I deem that it is of great necessity for us to gain various experience and competence, which may bring us power, arouse our passion for life and help us broaden our horizons. 

Accordingly, society as a whole should foster a positive atmosphere to educate and encourage teenagers to read diverse books and attend sorts of lectures if time and energy is available. Everyone should bear in mind that knowledge is power, treasure and the journey to a promising future.

The image portrays two students standing in front of a campus lecture poster. The student on the left dismisses the lecture as irrelevant to his major, **deeming** it unnecessary. In contrast, the student on the right counters with a broader perspective, suggesting that the lecture could be beneficial for their overall development. This vividly illustrates the divergent attitudes individuals may adopt when faced with the same opportunity.

The implicit message conveyed here is **unmistakable**: to thrive, we must cultivate the habit of being well-prepared and open to learning beyond our immediate field of study. Persistent learning enables us to continuously engage in meaningful pursuits, despite challenges or setbacks. Moreover, a prepared mind equips us with the **resilience** to confront future challenges and **lays** **the** **groundwork** **for** eventual success. According to a recent global survey, approximately 76.5% of respondents affirmed that they are willing to pursue diverse knowledge, as they believe opportunities **favor** those who are prepared.

In conclusion, only when we fully comprehend the importance of broad learning and **readiness** can we integrate this mindset into our daily lives and make consistent progress. Hence, mass media, including television and the Internet, should promote this positive mentality. As college students, we too must seize every opportunity to expand our knowledge, thereby securing a promising future.

The image vividly illustrates two students standing in front of a campus lecture poster. The student on the left expresses his opinion, claiming that since the lecture is unrelated to his major, it is of no use. In contrast, his peer **contends** that the lecture might contribute to both academic and personal growth. This scenario highlights the divergent attitudes people adopt toward the same opportunity.

Undoubtedly, the author strives to convey a profound message: one must always be well-prepared for opportunities. It is through continuous learning that we remain capable of achieving admirable accomplishments, even in the face of challenges and setbacks. Moreover, a prepared mind not only **energizes** us to confront future challenges but also lays a solid foundation for success. A recent survey conducted by an international organization revealed that approximately 76.5% of respondents believe that extensive learning is key to being ready for unexpected opportunities, reinforcing the idea that luck **favors** the prepared.

**Weighing the aforementioned factors**, it becomes clear that only when we fully grasp the importance of preparation and actively pursue knowledge can we foster the mindset needed for future success. Therefore, the mass media, including television and the Internet, should play a **pivotal** role in advocating a **proactive** and **growth-oriented** mindset. As university students, it is our duty to seize every opportunity to expand our knowledge beyond the classroom. In doing so, we can embrace a promising future built on continuous self-improvement.

Clearly, the picture above illustrates the divergent attitudes students hold towards campus lectures. As vividly depicted, the girl on the left dismisses the lecture, claiming, "We will not benefit much from the lecture, as it’s not directly related to our major." In contrast, the girl on the right argues, "We will gain something useful as long as we attend."

This image **underscores** an important message: college students should not **limit** **their attention solely to** their specialized fields of study. Several reasons support this view. Firstly, individuals equipped with a **well-rounded** set of knowledge and skills are more **competitive** in the job market. In other words, compared to those whose **expertise** is confined to a single discipline, those with broader capabilities have significantly more opportunities and a greater potential for career advancement. Secondly, focusing exclusively on one’s major while neglecting other areas of knowledge **hinders** students from applying what they have learned in a **holistic** manner, whether in their future careers or personal lives.

Thus, it is essential for college students to pursue comprehensive development by acquiring a diverse range of knowledge and skills. Only by embracing a wide array of disciplines can they make substantial progress and secure a brighter future.

This is a simple but enlightening cartoon, in which there is a youngster, with great disappointment on his face, complaining, “I want to learn the traditional opera, but my friend told me that it is boring.” Then, his father encourages him, “What does matter is that you like it.” 

The father’s encouragement, apparently, can be associated to the significance of sticking to one’s dream. To my understanding, successful figures are characterized by their various merits, such as their optimism, confidence, diligence and independent thinking. However, in reality, so many young people, like the boy in the picture, are often affected by others’ opinions and even give up what they really want. This phenomenon is particularly worth attention for the reason that they care much about what others say, ignoring the importance of adhering to their own thoughts. In fact, this negative state of mind has constituted an obstacle that hinders their progress and growth. 

I, as a college student, deem that it is of great necessity for us to do what we like, which can bring us power, arouse our passion for striving and help us eventually achieve dreams.Everyone should bear in mind that it is our perseverance not others’ comments that leads to our own success and a promising future.

Furthermore, it **instills** **in** us a positive mindset, allowing us to persevere even when immediate results are not in our favor, reassuring us that success is within reach as long as we persist.

Self-confidence, however, is not **innate** but rather cultivated through experiences and reflection. **It is a skill that can be honed, practiced, and ultimately mastered**. ==Once== this vital trait is developed, it ==not only== transforms one’s perspective ==but also== equips individuals with the tools to navigate life’s uncertainties with grace and **poise**. **In essence**, confidence **empowers** us to stay true to ourselves and pursue our passions, regardless of external judgment.

**What is graphically and explicitly depicted in the simple yet eye-catching drawing is** a father engaging in a conversation with his son, who appears troubled. **Upon closer inspection**, one can observe that the boy, **clad** **in** traditional Chinese **attire**, **articulates** his **apprehensions** about pursuing drama, while his father offers words of encouragement. This interaction highlights a critical theme: the significance of self-confidence in our lives.

Self-confidence undeniably plays a vital role in our daily experiences. Throughout our lives, we invariably encounter challenges and navigate difficult situations.

These two drawings, apparently, can be associated with two distinct habits. In the left one, there is a girl beside a desk, being absorbed in learning, with an idea in her mind— it is advisable to complete as early as possible. By contrast, in the right picture, a young guy sits leisurely in a sofa, telling himself, “I need not act until the deadline.” Finally, two Chinese characters can be noticed, which say “habit”. 

Successful figures are usually characterized by their diverse merits, including diligence, perseverance and striving every day. However, in reality, a host of youngsters are accustomed to taking no action until the last day. This terrible habit is particularly worth attention and as a matter of fact, their laziness has constituted an obstacle that hinders their personal growth and progress. 

To my understanding, we are supposed to accomplish our assignments on time each day. This good habit can be likened to a journey, leading to success and a promising future. A case in point is myself. During the past year, as a senior who has been preparing for the national entrance examination for postgraduate studies, I have never postponed one day’s task until the next day. This excellent habit ensures my motivation for learning, brings me power and helps me accumulate knowledge every day. 

To conclude, never put off till tomorrow what you can do today. Meanwhile, every one should bear in mind that a positive habit means a lifelong treasure.

**Portrayed distinctively by the two cartoons above is** an impressive scene: a girl in the left cartoon is completing her homework and **asserting** that early completion is preferable. Conversely, the boy in the right cartoon is seated at his desk, stating that he will not finish his homework until the last minute.

Undoubtedly, the symbolic implication of the pictures is to highlight the importance of cultivating good habits, ==particularly== the habit of effective time management. On one hand, efficient time management is critical to personal development. As the old saying goes, "Time is money." In our fast-paced modern life, it appears that we are constantly faced with numerous tasks and responsibilities. In such a context, it is essential to recognize that efficiency is the key to saving time, and time management skills inevitably lead to personal success. On the other hand, good time management habits play a vital role in the advancement of society as a whole. There is no doubt that social progress is closely linked to the efforts of each individual. If we can cultivate effective time management habits, we are far more likely to enhance our efficiency and achieve better performance in both learning and working processes, contributing significantly to societal advancement and prosperity.

In light of the aforementioned points, we can conclude that the importance of efficient time management skills is equally vital for both personal and social progress. Therefore, we should **leverage** this phenomenon to enlighten the public, and the media is expected to take the lead in promoting the value of developing good time management habits. Only in this way can we secure a bright future.

**As is vividly portrayed in the set of cartoons**, the drawing on the left depicts a girl diligently working on her assignments, asserting, “My heart will rest after I finish my work.” It can be **surmised** that she has been working for a significant amount of time, as her notebook is far from empty. In contrast, the drawing on the right illustrates a boy **lounging on** a sofa, **proclaiming**, “I would not take action until the very last minute.”

Clearly, the cartoonist intends to **commend** the girl ==while== **critiquing** the boy. It is undeniable that taking action is often less comfortable than resting. However, engaging in tasks early proves to be beneficial, while **procrastination** typically exacerbates the situation. If we begin our assignments early, we are likely to complete them ahead of time, allowing ample opportunity to review our work thoroughly. Moreover, thorough checking invariably leads to refinement. Conversely, if we develop a habit of procrastination and become accustomed to submitting our assignments at the last possible moment, we will have limited time for revisions, resulting in **a plethora of** mistakes in our submissions.

All in all, we should cultivate the habit of taking action early, as this practice is inevitably advantageous for us. Furthermore, the mass media shoulder the responsibility of encouraging individuals, especially college students, to embrace early action. Therefore, it is imperative that the media plays an active role in promoting the value of early action among individuals, particularly college students.

This drawing, apparently, can be associated with two distinct attitudes in front of adversities. Why? Then, let us closely observe it. On a journey to a high mountain, there is a youngster, sitting for a rest and sighing, “I am too tired to climb.” By contrast, his partner encourages him to continue after a rest. Two Chinese characters, finally, can be noticed, which says “on the journey”. 

Successful individuals are featured with their various excellent qualities, including strong wills and the spirit of perseverance. However, a host of young people, in reality, tend to give up when encountering challenges during the pursuit of success. This phenomenon is particularly worth attention and to my understanding, persistence can be likened to a road, leading to success. A case in point is me. As a senior who is preparing for the national entrance examination for postgraduate, I am firmly convinced that perseverance always brings me power, arouses my enthusiasm for the future and helps me conquer so many hardships. 

As a matter of fact, the thought of “giving up” may constituted an obstacle that hinders many people’s growth and progress in work, life and study. Thus, everyone should bear in mind that “Never give up, you will eventually achieve your dreams.”

**As is symbolically and explicitly demonstrated in the cartoon above**, two individuals are depicted climbing a mountain. The person on the left, **sporting** a backpack and a **beaming** smile, is encouraging the other, who is unexpectedly seated halfway up the mountain, **contemplating** giving up. This scenario effectively highlights the importance of persistence.

These two characters vividly **epitomize** a prevalent social phenomenon in life’s journey. Some individuals possess the vision and determination to pursue their dreams, while others, conversely, may **succumb** to discouragement despite the encouragement and support from their teammates. Hence, we **cannot overemphasize** the significance of persistence, as it enables us to overcome adversities and hardships throughout our long journey in life. ==Without it==, we risk ending up in failure and despair.

A **prime** example of this is basketball player Yao Ming, who is renowned for his ability to slam dunk. His success is a result of relentless effort and unwavering dedication to his dreams, demonstrating that he never **relinquishes** his ideals.

From the preceding discussion, it is readily apparent that persistence is **a prerequisite for** success. Life is indeed a long journey, and **staying committed to** our initial motivations is essential to reaching our destination.

**Vividly illustrated in the above picture are two young college students climbing a famous mountain.** One student, exhausted and sitting on the steps, exclaims, “I’m too tired and don’t want to climb any more.” In contrast, the other student offers him a bottle of water and encourages him to rest before continuing the climb. The caption under the picture reads, “On the way to the top of a mountain.”

This cartoon reflects a prevalent phenomenon: perseverance is an indispensable part of our lives. This notion has **garnered** significant public attention and **provoked** heated discussions recently. No one would deny that perseverance is a fundamental attribute of high achievers, **distinguishing top performers from the rest**. After years of research, Professor Liu, a leading authority in sociology, once stated, “It was by sticking to their aims that some of history’s most notable leaders created incredible miracles, such as winning great wars or establishing vast empires from scratch.” Furthermore, a **compelling** example of the benefits of perseverance is the success story of Jack Ma. Lacking a technical educational background and a degree from any **top-tier** university, he nonetheless became a **dot-com** billionaire through his persistent innovation in the online marketplace.

As a qualified college student, I firmly believe that we can derive immense benefits from the spirit of perseverance.

A youngster sits in front of a course selection system, pondering over two groups of characteristics—the right one includes easy access to high scores, less difficulties in passing the test and less assignments; the left one involves the latest knowledge, emphasis on innovation or more challenging requirements. Finally, several Chinese characters can be noticed, which say 

Such a scenario is particularly worth attention for the reason that some students may focus much on the so-called “ease”, ignoring what they can acquire. As a matter of fact, their short-sighted behaviors have constituted an obstacle that hinders their growth and progress. On the contrary, intelligent students are convinced that it is of great necessity for them to take challenging electives with the latest knowledge and innovative spirit. Why? The contemporary society is best characterized by the speedy development of science and technology. Then, it is by acquiring the latest knowledge that they can keep up with the fast pace of social advancement. In addition, they believe that innovation can be likened to a bridge, leading to a more promising future. 

I prefer challenging tasks, since these courses, to my understanding, can bring me motivation to learn, arouse my passion for academic success and help me broaden my horizons.

Personally, I would **opt for** the latter, and here are my reasons.

In today's fiercely competitive academic landscape, college students must equip themselves with a robust skill set. Courses that delve into advanced knowledge not only broaden our intellectual horizons but also deepen our understanding of complex topics. Furthermore, these courses emphasize creativity, empowering me to cultivate innovative perspectives that will enhance my marketability in the **job arena**. Lastly, engaging with challenging material fosters a profound sense of achievement, contributing significantly to my personal development and resilience.

As vividly depicted in the graph, a student sits in front of a computer, selecting courses while taking into account numerous factors, including innovation, the freshness of knowledge, the level of difficulty, as well as scoring, pass rates, and the burden of assignments. The caption states, "Course selection is in progress," highlighting the importance of comprehensive consideration when making choices.

From this portrayal, we can infer that well-rounded contemplation—a significant quality—serves as an indispensable capability that positively impacts various aspects of our lives. The value of comprehensive and sophisticated thinking is evidenced by numerous examples in our surroundings, such as governmental policy-making and the selection of compulsory and elective courses. If we can implement this notion in practice, it will exert profound and constructive influence. Thus, well-rounded and thorough thinking contributes significantly to both community prosperity and personal development.

Regardless of the difficulties or situations we face, those who possess the ability to analyze different components and integrate them effectively are closer to achieving success. Therefore, well-rounded consideration is the wisdom we should strive to embody.

In the ﬁrst cartoon, there is a youngster, sitting leisurely in a chair and ﬂaunting his large number of books, with no book in hands. However, in the right picture, although the guy has just a few books, he has made his mind to do his utmost to read 20 books in this year. Several Chinese characters, finally, can be noticed, which say “having books” and “reading books”. 

These two pictures are particularly worth attention for the reason that the painter focuses on what the true reading is. In the contemporary society, a host of people prefer to purchase, store and even ﬂaunt their books, but they may never read any books. This phenomenon is rather ridiculous. As a matter of fact, everyone should bear in mind that books should be read and not be boasted. Reading books, as a positive habit, brings us knowledge, arouses our enthusiasm for future life and enhances our quality. It is books that enable us to acquire not only knowledge, but also conﬁdence, optimism and courage to face any adversity.

I, as a college student, am convinced that society as a whole should foster a positive atmosphere to educate and encourage all people to not only purchase books, but also to be absorbed in reading books.

Intuitively, these pictures are thought-provoking, depicting two contrasting attitudes toward books. In the left picture, a man sits comfortably with a bookcase full of diverse books behind him, proudly saying, “I have so many books.” In contrast, the right picture shows a man determined to read 20 books in a year. This contrast conveys an important message: it is more meaningful to absorb knowledge from books than to merely own them.

If we only focus on the superficial details, we might miss the cartoonist's deeper message. The cartoonist ironically contrasts two different approaches to books. The first man is content simply owning numerous books, as if collecting them alone were an achievement. On the other hand, the second man is genuinely engaged in reading and learning from each book, marking his progress and gaining insights. This is the approach that should be valued and promoted.

In conclusion, the cartoon highlights the importance of truly absorbing knowledge from books. With the rapid development of technology and the easy access to information, it is more critical than ever to approach reading with a mindset of personal growth. While owning books might bring a sense of pride, it is the knowledge we gain from them that truly matters.

In the first cartoon, there is a father, sitting in front of a computer, playing games and urging his son to work hard, but the youngster takes no action. By contrast, in the second one, although the father does not require his kid to study, the child concentrates on learning when his dad begins to learn. Finally, several Chinese characters can be noticed, which say that instead of merely requiring, parents should be models for children. 

These two pictures are particularly worth attention for the reason that they focus on how parents should educate their kids in life and study. In contemporary China, it has become a trend for an increasing number of parents to demand their teenagers to work hard for academic success, but they set negative examples. A case in point is the father in the left picture. To my understanding, the strength of role models is infinite. As positive models, parents can bring kids power, arouse their enthusiasm for study , and help them to grow healthily. Unfortunately, many parents’ bad behaviors have constituted an obstacle that hinders kids’ growth and progress. 

As a college student, I am convinced that it is of great necessity for parents to enhance their positive impacts on children by behaving appropriately. Meanwhile, society as a whole should forge a positive atmosphere to criticize and reject parents’ negative examples for kids.

This is a simple but enlightening cartoon ： beside a table sit four youngsters, staring at their smart cell phones, with tasty foods uneaten. Although they gather to enhance friendship, scarcely do these guys chat with each other. Finally, several Chinese characters are given, which say “dinning together in the era of cell phones”. 

Such a scenario, apparently, can be associated with the excessive use of cell phones among teenagers. As a matter of fact, cell phones have constituted an obstacle that hinders people’s normal communication. A case in point is that a host of youngsters, like the guys in the picture, spend much time on mobile phones to surf the Internet, chat with friends or comment others’ We-chats. This trend is particularly worth attention for the reason that they are addicted to the virtual world, ignoring the real life. 

All phone users should bear in mind that cell phones are just tools. I am convinced that it is not advisable for youngsters to be slave of mobile phones. Accordingly, we should utilize modern technological products rationally, including the Internet, cell phones, TV and computers.

The above drawings emphasize the harmony and happiness of a mother and her daughter. Three decades ago, the young mother held her little lovely angel’s hand, walking on a road, with sweet smiles on their faces. Now, although the mom becomes aged and the daughter has grown up, they still enjoy the same happiness. Finally, two Chinese characters interpret the intended meaning, namely, “mutual supporting”. 

This common scene is particularly worth attention for the reason that the drawer focuses on the traditional Chinese virtues ： filial piety and loving kids, which characterize a happy family. Filial piety brings the aged parents power, arouses their enthusiasm for life and helps them enjoy their twilight. Meanwhile, intelligent parents in large numbers have realized the significance of loving children. Thus, it has become a common expectation for a host of families in China to forge a harmonious atmosphere for both children and aged parents. It is their mutual supporting that enables both the young and the senior to acquire long-time happiness. A case in point the mother and her daughter in the pictures. 

As a college student, I am convinced that it is of vital necessity for every family in China to preserve this traditional virtue. Accordingly, it is advisable for youngsters to spare adequate time to accompany their old parents, no matter how busy they are, because without parents’ supporting, it is impossible for young people to grow up.

Although there are diverse options, these youngsters do not know how to choose, with great confusion on their faces. Finally, two Chinese characters can be noticed, which say “choices” .

Such a scenario, apparently, can be naturally associated with a great many confused young people in real life. To be specific, an increasing number of college students get puzzled when they have to make choices after graduation. This phenomenon is particularly worth attention for the reason that many universities may focus merely on students’ academic study, ignoring the importance of the career guidance. It is schools’ neglect that causes young people to possess inadequate competence or confidence to make intelligent choices. 

Accordingly, every university should foster a positive atmosphere to help and encourage youngsters to make career plans in advance. During this process, it is advisable for them to consult teachers, parents and successful people. For me, I choose to prepare for the national entrance examination for postgraduate studies. This is a challenging choice, but I deem this process will definitely bring me opportunity to change, arouse my enthusiasm for study and enhance myself to a large extent.

In the cartoon, a pessimistic guy stands beside an over-turned bottle, with great desperation on his face, uttering a remark ： “It’s over/ screwed up.” However, the other youngster stoops down to pick up the bottle, with great joy and excitement, commenting: “Nice, there is still something left.” Although they see the same bottle, these two men’s reactions totally differ. 

Such a scenario, apparently, can be associated with two distinct attitudes toward the adversity—pessimism and optimism. In reality, so many young people, like the left boy in the picture, lose confidence in front of setbacks. This phenomenon is particularly worth attention for the reason that they may merely see the hazard, and even exaggerate it. It is their pessimistic attitude that causes them to see no hope, no chance or no possibility of change. 

To my understanding, optimism can be likened to a journey, which leads to success. A case in point is me. As a senior who is preparing for the national entrance examination for postgraduate studies, I encounter diverse challenges nearly every day. Anyway, an optimistic mind brings me power, arouses my passion for striving and helps me conquer hardships. In a nutshell, everyone should bear in mind that opportunities originate from a positive and optimistic mind.
