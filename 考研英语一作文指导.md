### 大作文

根据考研兔资料，在 23 届之前的大作文中，英语一主要考察的是图画作文，英语二主要考察图表作文。现在英一和英二的新大纲考察范围都变为图画、图表、文字(新增)作文三种，即现在的新大纲对英语一和英语二大作文的要求是相同的。

英一和英二大作文的考察要求：文字、图画、图表等描述性、叙述性、说明性、论述性文章；但是以考试连贯性的惯例来看，考试不会突然出现很大的变化，所以大家可以依旧参考以往的标准，英语一以图画为主，英语二以图表为主，剩下的当然也要掌握，以防万一。

* 第一段重在描述（直白地还原图上的内容），
* 第二段重在解释/理解（进一步深入解释图反映的社会现象及其原因等等），
* 第三段重在议论/评价（好、值得提倡还是坏、坚决抵制，社会各方要怎么做，尤其是自身要怎么做等等）。

**第一段：描述**

Unfolded in the elaborately-painted left cartoon is an enlightening scene that two citizens are jogging in the public fitness area and a young adult nearby proudly says, “The new park which was built near my home is so desirable”. In the right bar chart, we can see that the number of parks in a city rose sharply from 406 in 2020 to 670 in 2022. **There is no doubt that its symbolic meaning subtly conveyed should be given deep consideration.**【[中国教育在线](https://www.eol.cn/m/kaoyan/202312/t20231226\_2551123.shtml)】

There is a picture and a bar chart presented above. In the left picture, a little boy is pointing to the recently built park and saying, "This park is really nice," with a few people running and walking behind him. The right graph shows changes in the number of parks from 2020 to 2022, with the number rising from 406 to 670.【[知乎](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/673903573)】

And there is not be ignored, a comment from elderly couples who are appreciating the more and more wonderful activities in recent years.【[希赛](https://www.educity.cn/kyyy/5290185.html)】

**Unfolded in the elaborately painted cartoon is an eye-catching and thought-stimulating scene:** some young men are rowing dragon boats,and a large number of people crowded to watch the game. An aged grandma turned to her spouse and said cheerfully:“it is wonderful that the Dragon Boat racing is getting increasingly lively in our village.”Apparently, what the cartoonist attempts to emphasize is the inheritance of traditional culture.【[新东方](https://kaoyan.koolearn.com/20221224/1578637.html)】

**Here is a picture, interesting and with profound implication. As is vividly depicted in the photo**, two elderly people are watching the dragon boat races, which successfully captures our eyes. They are satisfied and delighted to see the growing popularity of Dragon Boat Race with an increasing number of people getting involved.

Clearly, the picture above shows students' different attitudes towards campus lectures. As is vividly shown in the picture, the girl on the left complains,"We will not benefit much from the lecture, because it's not related to our major."However, the girl on the right says,"We will learn something useful as long as we attend it."【[新东方](https://kaoyan.koolearn.com/20211225/1483468.html)】

Graphically depicted in the picture is a scene,in which there are two students standing in front of a poster of a campus lecture. "The individual on the left airs his perspective that it doesn't belong to his major and it is useless to listen to the lecture. Conversely, his counterpart holds the opposite idea that it may be useful to our study and growth. We are informed that various folks take different attitudes toward the same scene.【[文都考研](https://kaoyan.wendu.com/2021/1225/199480.shtml)】

**What is graphically and explicitly depicted in the simple yet eye-catching drawing is** that on the ground stands a father, who is having a talk with his son. Impressively, at second glance, it is not difficult to observe that the boy, dressed in a traditional Chinese costume, expresses his concern about studying drama, while his father offer some words of encouragement.【[希赛](https://www.educity.cn/kyyy/2120020.html)】

**As is vividly depicted in the photo,** a father and his son in a costume are having a conversation, which successfully attracts our attention. What makes the photo more attractive is the fact that the kid says unhappily, “Dad, my classmates consider Chinese opera boring”, while his father replies, “It is good enough as long as you like it.” Clearly, the photo has shown an implied meaning that it is important to be confident, which needs to be given further analysis.【[新东方](https://kaoyan.koolearn.com/20210716/1459489.html)】

**Portrayed distinctively by the two cartoons above is** an impressive scene: a girl in the left picture is doing homework and saying that early completion is better. Nevertheless, the boy in the right picture is siting in front of the desk and saying that he will not finish the homework until the last minute.【[希赛](https://www.educity.cn/kyyy/2029182.html)】

**As is vividly portrayed in the set of cartoons**, the drawing on the left depicts a girl keeping her pen moving and saying, “My heart will rest after I finish my work”. It could be surmised that she has worked for a long time because her notebook is not empty. In contrast, the drawing on the right describes that a boy is resting on a sofa, saying, “I would not take actions until the very last minute.”【[新东方](https://kaoyan.xdf.cn/202001/11017825.html)】

There are, **as is symbolically and explicitly demonstrated in the cartoon above**, two individuals climbing a mountain, with one guy on the left wearing a bag on the back and a beaming smile on the face who is encouraging the other one, unexpectedly, sitting on the half way and wanting to give up, which indicates the importance of persistence.【[新东方](https://kaoyan.koolearn.com/20181223/1032117.html)】

**Vividly illustrated in the above picture are** two young college students climbing a famous mountain. One student, sitting on the steps too tired to continue climbing, said, “I’m too tired and don’t want to climb any more.” Another one, however, gave him a bottle of water and encouraged him to have a rest and then go on climbing. The caption under the picture reads, “On the way to the top of a mountain”.【[中国教育在线](https://kaoyan.eol.cn/nnews/201812/t20181223\_1638264.shtml)】

As is depicted by the picture, a student is selecting courses. He is considering whether to choose the courses which are high scored, easily passed with less homework, or to choose those that contain new knowledge, focus on creating and are difficult to learn. From my perspective, I will choose the latter ones. The reasons are as follows.【[中国教育在线](https://kaoyan.eol.cn/shiti/yingyu/201712/t20171223\_1575557.shtml)】

As is vividly depicted in the graph that sitting in front of a computer, a student is selecting the curriculum, taking numerous elements into consideration including the innovation, the freshness of knowledge and the level of difficulty as well as the scoring, the qualified rate and burden of assignment. The caption says: The course selecting is on the way, indicating the importance of well-rounded consideration while making a choice.【[文都考研](https://kaoyan.wendu.com/2018/0716/121402.shtml)】

**As is graphically portrayed in the cartoon**, sitting on a small boat are two tourists who are taking sightseeing, discarding their picnic leftovers casually into the lake, with all kinds of rubbish such as containers, fishbones, banana peel, tins, and so on floating on the river. Meanwhile, below the drawing are four characters saying,"’The Leftovers' of the Traveling."【考研兔】

What an impressive picture it is！ Two young men sitting on the boat are throwing rubbish into the lake, with all kinds of garbage floating on the surface. What is conveyed in the picture is both realistic and thought-provoking.【[人民网](http://edu.people.com.cn/n/2013/0906/c1053-22830791-4.html)】

What an enlightening and thought-provoking image it is! It is so vivid and lively that whoever in front of it may be greatly interested. What is subtly presented in the interesting and instructive picture above is that a tourist in a sight-seeing boat is throwing waste into the lake, which is already full of various wastes. What on earth does the drawer really attempt to convey?【[新浪微博](https://edu.sina.com.cn/kaoyan/2011-01-15/1939282473.shtml)】

What the picture and the chart convey are a favorable phenomenon that even more people now increasingly pay close attention to doing exercise, which is vital to a society. **The following factors, from my perspective, might illustrate this theme**. First and foremost, doing exercise is beneficial to physical health and it can help reduce obesity and lower fat content by promoting blood circulation, This is why more youngsters are willing to participate in exercise regularly in life. What's more, it can be attributed to the relevant policy from our government to promote the growth of parks. According to a survey conducted by China Research Center, up to 1000 new parks were built last year all over the nation in order to encourage citizens to do exercise.【[中国教育在线](https://www.eol.cn/m/kaoyan/202312/t20231226\_2551123.shtml)】【分析原因】 The meaning of the two pictures is obvious. Firstly, an increasing number of people realize the importance of health, so parks that can provide fresh air and beautifiul scenery have become people's first choice. In addition, the increase in the number of parks also depends on government policies. Without government's support, relevant departments will not invest enough budget in park construction. Of course, the phenomenon is also closely related to economic development. It is precisely because of economic development that people have more time and mood to go to parks and enjoy life, and the government has more money to carry out infrastructure construction.【[知乎](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/673903573)】【分析原因】

What behind the picture is clear: the increasing number of younger is participating in and paying more attention to traditional culture and festivals. One can find that the considerable ways of celebrating traditional culture has gone viral on Chinese social media platform, such as Sina Weibo, Xiaohongshu, with millions of users. Also, the education of cultural heritage is welcomed by students from primary level to college students. Our treasure, such as moon cake festival, spring festival, will be explored further if Chinese young generation are active in joining rather than just sending a message or red envelope.【[希赛](https://www.educity.cn/kyyy/5290185.html)】【举例论证】

There is no denying that our Chinese, in recent years, have been attaching great importance to the carrying of the traditional culture and bringing it to vitality. Traditions are supposed to be inherited and advocated from one generation to another. Like tangible cultural heritages such as Great Wall and the Forbidden City, intangible cultural heritages like Peking Opera and celebration of traditional festivals are equally crucial. As a country consisting ofa great diversity of ethnic groups and with time-honored history and civilization, China abounds in intangible cultural heritages, which connect modern people to the historical past, allowing them to acquire a cultural and historical identity. Without cultural heritages, we would be rendered absolutely rootless and we would find it hard to cope with challenges at present and in the future.【[新东方](https://kaoyan.koolearn.com/20221224/1578637.html)】【举例论证+假设论证】

Actually, the cartoon shows a heated phenomenon, namely, the inheritance of traditional festivals and culture. **Theoretically, this issue can be analyzed from several perspectives, but for my part, the following three are of utmost importance.** First of all, the comprehensive and continuous development of our economy might exert great influence, which allows residents to lead a full and varied life and participate in festival celebrations. In addition, this situation may exist based on the fact that our country has been sparing no efforts to protect and carry forward traditional festival sand customs. Furthermore, the role of the media is also noteworthy whose publicity and coverage further expand the public's attention to traditional festivals and customs, especially among young people.【[升研教育](https://www.shengyan985.com/yingyu/3734.html)】【分析原因】

Clearly, **we can deduce from the picture that** with the rapid development of economy, tourism as a form of enterprise brings China a lot of benefits, but the environment is being polluted tremendously. 【对比论证】In public places people have no awareness that they are doing something damaging the environment, the only environment we have. They cause inconvenience and discomfort to other tourists, and also degrade China's image as a nation.【[人民网](http://edu.people.com.cn/n/2013/0906/c1053-22830791-4.html)】【整体上使用了归纳论证或因果论证】

Studying it further, we may find that funny as it appears, its implications are apparently far-reaching -------- people in mounting numbers nowadays have not been aware of their environment-polluting behavior just yet. Indeed, nowhere in history has this issue been concerned so much as in our society today. It should be observed，of course, that similar events are now available in nearly all walks of life for the time being. Looking around, we can find upsetting parallels too numerous to list: in the cinema, on the square, and even on the train.【[新浪微博](https://edu.sina.com.cn/kaoyan/2011-01-15/1939282473.shtml)】【举例论证】

What can we learn from the above chart? **A lot of benefits of practice classes will be brought to students.** Firstly, knowledge are extremely available to most of students by combination of theory and practice, which, perhaps, can improve students’ academic pursuits. Secondly, there is no doubt that low-skilled university students can get good training.

**Several factors, from my perspective, can be easily found to account for the phenomenon, among which I would like to name three most significant ones as follows.** in the first place, it is universally acknowledged that the relevant health departments has spared more efforts to advocate and encourage the public to pay attention to the physical and mental health. In addition, there is no denying that with the rapid development of social media such as short videos, more and more residents can get more health tips online. Last but not least, the sudden outbreak of COVlD-19 in2019 has been a wake-up call for many people, who began to focus on healthy and nutritious diet and do exercise, which is another significantI34factor that could not be ignored.【[升研教育](https://www.shengyan985.com/yingyu/3739.html)】【因果论证】

The increasing health literacy levels reflect positive outcomes of public health initiatives and education programs aimed at enhancing the general knowledge of health among residents. This trend suggests that people are becoming more informed about health matters, preventive care, and how to maintain a healthier lifestyle, which is crucial for the overall wellbeing of society. The consistent growth could also be attributed to the rising access to information through digital platforms, where health-related content is more widely available and accessible.【GPT】【因果论证】

**What accounts for the increase?** From my perspective, at least three factors contribute to the changes. To begin with,the availability of computers and smartphones is the foremost contributor and the rapid development of information technology enables nearly everybody to have access to the Internet. More importantly,the change is closely related to the rising income of the Chinese people, especially the residents living in rural areas. Finally, the changes are enhanced and promoted by the government's bettering policies as well as the more convenient channels in the e-commerce field.【[新东方](https://kaoyan.koolearn.com/20211225/1483473.html)】【因果论证】

**The rapid growth in express deliveries, particularly from rural areas, can be attributed to several factors, including** the expansion of e-commerce, improved rural infrastructure, and supportive government policies. E-commerce platforms have penetrated deeply into rural markets, providing greater access to goods and services. Investments in rural transportation and logistics networks have also facilitated easier delivery to these areas. Furthermore, government initiatives aimed at boosting rural economies and integrating them into the digital economy have likely played a crucial role in this growth. Overall, the data reflects a dynamic and evolving express delivery landscape in China, with rural areas becoming key contributors to the industry's continued expansion.【GPT version】【因果论证】

**What accounts for the phenomenon?** As far as I’m concerned, there are mainly two reasons for that. It is partly because exercising alone makes it easy for people to arrange their exercise time according to their own schedules. Another factor may be that people could choose the forms of exercise that they prefer without negotiating with others when exercising alone.【[新东方](https://kaoyan.koolearn.com/20210701/1456458.html)】【因果论证】

The data suggests that individual exercise is the preferred mode of physical activity among the residents. This could indicate a strong inclination towards personal fitness goals, flexibility, or simply a preference for solitude during exercise. Exercising with friends is also a popular choice, reflecting the social aspect of physical activities, which can enhance motivation and enjoyment. The relatively lower percentages for exercising with family and participating in group activities might indicate logistical challenges, varying schedules, or a lesser emphasis on family and community-based fitness in this city.【GPT】【因果论证】

**There are diverse components contributing to the above trend, but generally speaking, they may put down to the following two aspects.** initially, there is no doubt that recent years have witnessed the rapid development of economy, and people's living standards have been improved remarkably, as a result of which, an increasing number of parents are likely to buy their children a smart phone, which may provide possibility for students to apply more advanced equipment into study, to the extent that their leaming efficiency and reading horizons would be improved. Simultaneously, along with the development of technology and the advancement of the internet, a growing quantity of college students' reading habits have been changed because mobile phones would offer more convenience during their study, which should be taken into account.【[希赛](https://www.educity.cn/kyyy/2031167.html)】【因果论证】

**The reasons behind might be as follows.** Most students would prefer to find a job so that they could gain the skills and experience that are crucial for a brighter career path; Besides, most jobs only require that applicants have bachelor degree so most graduates are qualified. Despite of that, the competition for well-paid jobs is still fierce, accompanied with universities' policy to expand the number of postgraduates, more students choose to pursue higher degree. At last, it is very challenging to start a business for graduates who lack the resources and experience, so that number was very small. With more favorable conditions provided by government to encourage high-technology star-ups, some graduates were willing to take the opportunity to become entrepreneurs.【[希赛](https://www.educity.cn/kyyy/1981907.html)】【因果论证】

The data reflects a notable shift in the priorities of high school graduates over the five-year period. The decline in the percentage of students opting for immediate employment suggests a growing emphasis on further education, perhaps driven by the belief that higher qualifications will lead to better job prospects in the long term. This trend may also indicate an increasing awareness of the competitive nature of the job market, where more advanced skills and education are becoming essential.【因果论证】

The small but noticeable rise in entrepreneurship indicates a gradual shift towards innovative and independent career paths, although it remains a less common choice compared to traditional employment and further studies. This trend could be encouraged by creating more supportive environments for young entrepreneurs, such as providing resources, mentorship, and exposure to entrepreneurial education.【GPT】【因果论证】

Obviously, **the author of these pictures aims to praise the girl and criticize the boy**. It must be admitted that taking actions is less comfortable than resting. In effect, however, taking actions early benefits us and delaying always makes things worse. 【对比论证】If we start finishing our assignments early, we may finish it early and have much extra time to check it carefully and checking, doubtlessly, means perfecting. 【假设论证】However, if we have formed the habit of delaying, and become accustomed to submit our assignments a minute before the deadline, we are likely to have little time to check our work so that there will be a large number of mistakes in our work.【假设论证】【[新东方](https://kaoyan.xdf.cn/202001/11017825.html)】

**Undoubtedly, the symbolic implication of the pictures is to show us that importance should be attached to** the formation of good habits, especially the good habit of time management. On the one hand, efficient time management is critical to personal development. As the old saying goes, “Time is money,” and in the fast-paced modern life, it seems that we always have a lot of things to do and we are very busy. In the face of such a situation, we have to realize that efficiency holds the key to saving time and time management skills hold the key to personal success. On the other hand, good time management habits play a vital role in the development of the whole society. There is no doubt that, to a large extent, social progress is closely related to the efforts of each individual. If we can develop the good habit of time management, we are much more likely to improve efficiency and have a better performance in the learning and working process, which is an integral part of social advances and prosperity.【[中国教育在线](https://kaoyan.eol.cn/shiti/yingyu/201912/t20191221\_1700458.shtml)】

#### 写作话题

上面的内容只能说是通用的套话，只需要记住自己喜欢的即可。但是如果对图画所反映的主题不熟悉不了解，写不出好的内容，上面的套话是难以发挥作用的。所以可以在平日里积累一些热门话题的表达，熟练掌握。

但是，值得指出，这一块内容属于“锦上添花”，如果考查到就是赚到，但是如果没有考查到自己准备的话题也不用担心，把前面的结构式套话记好，能保证拿一个中等偏上的水平就非常好了。因为考查话题的不确定性，有可能准备了也没考查到，所以务必要衡量好投入产出比，看看投入多少的时间是比较合适的。
